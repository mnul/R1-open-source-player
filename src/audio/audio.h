 * Reapplies immediately at the current UI volume so a switch is audible
 * right away rather than waiting for the next slider touch. Has no effect

 * file -- see l_plugin_set_hw_volume_curve()'s own comment. Mutates ONLY
 * the live state audio_apply_volume() below actually reads -- never the
 * separate staging state the functions below operate on -- so this and a
 * plugin (re)load transaction in progress can never interfere with each
 * other's storage (see audio_stage_custom_hw_volume_curve()'s own comment

 *
 * This, plus audio_get_staged_hw_volume_curve_state() and
 * audio_commit_hw_volume_curve() below, exist for plugin_manager.c's own
 * (re)load transaction (a full deinit/init reload, or plain top-level
 * loading of several plugin files in a row, any of which may call
 * plugin.set_hw_volume_curve()) for two compounding reasons: (1)
 * audio_output_request_hw_volume_raw() (audio_output.c) is a single-slot
 * "latest wins" async handoff to a background worker thread, not a real
 * queue, so writing hardware after every intermediate state change during
 * a transaction risks an earlier, momentarily-active value actually
 * reaching the DAC as a real, audible blip before the transaction's own
 * true final value overwrites it -- or, if a later plugin in the same
 * transaction then fails, a value that was never meant to survive at all
 * being written anyway. (2) Mutating the SAME live state
 * audio_apply_volume() reads is not enough on its own to prevent that,
 * even with the write itself deferred: a plugin (re)load transaction runs
 * synchronously on the UI thread, but audio_request_volume()'s own
 * worker thread (a queued volume-slider drag sample, audio.c) runs
 * independently and can call audio_apply_volume() -- which DOES write
 * hardware immediately, unconditionally, by design -- at any moment,
 * including mid-transaction; if that read the live state, it could send
 * a transaction's not-yet-committed intermediate value (a temporary
 * native reset, an intermediate plugin's curve, or a curve belonging to
 * a plugin that goes on to fail) straight to the DAC on its own,
 * bypassing the deferred-write discipline entirely. Keeping staged state
 * completely separate closes this: nothing outside plugin_manager.c's own
 * transaction functions ever reads it, so a concurrent volume request
 * during a transaction always sees and writes only the LAST FULLY
 * COMMITTED state, never an in-progress one. plugin_manager.c stages
 * state changes here throughout the whole transaction, then calls
 * audio_commit_hw_volume_curve() exactly once at the very end to install
 * the staged result as the new live state and write hardware, atomically,
 * in one locked step. */

 * audio_stage_custom_hw_volume_curve() to restore exactly this moment's
 * staged state later) -- e.g. plugin_manager.c snapshotting before a
 * single plugin's top-level run, so a mid-script failure can roll the
