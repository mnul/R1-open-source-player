-- Low/High Gain switcher, adds a "Gain Mode" row to Settings -> Music
-- Settings -> Audio.
-- Reference implementation for plugin.set_hw_volume_curve() (PLUGIN API
-- 11, see PLUGINS.md) -- reproduces the R1's own stock firmware High/Low
-- Gain curves exactly, extracted from a real device's own
-- /usr/resource/ot_devices.json (VOLUMES[0].Gains[], names "HDB"/"LDB"),
-- not re-derived or guessed. Each is a raw hardware register value
-- (0-255, lower = louder, 0 = the DAC's own loudest point) for UI volume
-- 0%..100%; a uniform 12-step/6dB gap separates High from Low across
-- nearly the whole range, converging back to the same register (0) at
-- 100% -- see PLUGINS.md's own comment on why that means every gain mode
-- reaches the same physical peak loudness, just via a different curve
-- shape below it. The real firmware also defines a third "MDB" (Medium)
-- curve, but it's numerically identical to Low in the real device dump
-- this was extracted from, so it's left out here as a pointless third
-- option -- add it back if a different device/firmware revision turns out
-- to define it distinctly. If you have your own curve (e.g. tuned for a
-- specific pair of IEMs), replace either table below with your own 101
-- values -- that's the whole point of this API being a plugin primitive
-- rather than a fixed native setting.
--
-- api_min is deliberately 1, not 11 (the API version that actually added
-- plugin.set_hw_volume_curve()) -- api_min=11 would make plugin.define()
-- itself raise a native load error and abort the whole script on any
-- older player build, before the has_capability() check below ever ran,
-- making that check's own "needs a newer player build" fallback toast
-- unreachable dead code. Gating purely on has_capability() (what it is
-- for) instead lets this plugin load everywhere and degrade gracefully.
--
-- Also does NOT default a first-time install to either Gain Mode: an
-- unset/corrupted saved state leaves the app's own built-in volume taper
-- untouched until the user explicitly opens Settings -> Music Settings ->
-- Audio -> Gain Mode and picks one -- silently defaulting to High (or even
-- Low) would still be an unrequested, potentially startling loudness change
-- on first boot for whatever headphones happen to already be plugged in.
